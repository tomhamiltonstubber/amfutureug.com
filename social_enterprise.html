content: "We have been running the **Piggery** since 2015. The family of five who
  maintain the piggery live in the slums of Kampala. The Piggery has given them a
  business that enables them to pay for their children’s education, their rent, their
  food and just to escape the daily hustle of just surviving. They are now thriving.
  Three of the children attend school and the oldest girl Irene, is now in University.
  You can read about her story here. (can you make this a link) \n\nIn the future
  we would like to help other families create and maintain businesses, and to pull
  themselves out of extreme poverty. \n\nIf you are interested in donating to help
  us replicate this success, or would like to talk with us about it, please get in
  contact with us. \n\nEmail Gemma Hayes at [g.a.hayes@rug.nl](mailto:g.a.hayes@rug.nl)

We are very proud of what we have achieved in regards to our two business ventures. The “Piggery Project” and the “AmFuture Rehearsal Studio.”

The “Piggery Project” we have been running since 2015 and we are pleased that it has continued for 3 years. It is an income generating project for Mama Betty Nankya and her family. She has four children, 2 of whom are involved with AmFuture.
The Piggery has enabled them to pull themselves out of poverty. The family have worked really hard to make the Piggery what it is today.

The “AmFuture Rehearsal Studio” is our newest venture, started in 2018. AmFuture invested in acoustics material and instruments and air-conditioning. From this we have created the perfect space for musicians to rehearse and for church groups to meet.
  Already we are seeing results and we are being approached by lots of interested clients who pay us money for the use of our studio.
  The “Amfuture Rehearsal Studio” employs the Director of Amfuture,
  Ian Muwonge, as the Coordinator of the Rehearsal Studio, and also one of the youth Joseph Ntawali as Support Coordinator.
