  ## The AmFuture Studio

  The **AmFuture Studio** is our newest venture—launched in January 2018.

  AmFuture invested in the creation of a space with acoustics, instruments and air-conditioning. We have created the perfect space for musicians to rehearse and for other groups to meet and run their events, projects and groups. Our clientele are bands, church groups and other NGOs. Interest in equipment hire has grown organically, and this popular side of the business has also brought positive results. Staff and volunteers are always busy. The business is showing much potential to not only cover costs but also make money to pay for the charity work of AmFuture.

  The Amfuture Rehearsal Studio pays the wage of the Director of AmFuture, Ian Muwonge. We also employ one of the youth, Shaka Innocent as Support Coordinator.

  It is part of our mission to grow this business, to employ more staff and young people.

  If anyone is interested in joining us in this journey and to help us in our work, we would love to talk to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome.

  ## The Piggery

  We have been running the **Piggery** since 2015. The family of five who maintain the piggery live in the slums of Kampala. The Piggery has given them a business that enables them to pay for their children’s education, their rent, their food and just to escape the daily hustle of just surviving. They are now thriving. Three of the children attend school and the oldest girl Irene, is now in University.

  In the future we would like to help other families create and maintain businesses, and to pull themselves out of extreme poverty.

  If you are interested in donating to help us replicate this success, or would like to talk with us about it, please get in contact with us using the link below.
