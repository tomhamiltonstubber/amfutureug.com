  We are very proud of what we have achieved in regards to our two business ventures. The “Piggery Project” and the “AmFuture Rehearsal Studio.”
</p>
<p>
  The “Piggery Project” we have been running since 2015 and we are pleased that it has continued for 3 years. It is an
  income generating project for Mama Betty Nankya and her family. She has four children, 2 of whom are involved with AmFuture.
  The Piggery has enabled them to pull themselves out of poverty. The family have worked really hard to make the Piggery
  what it is today.

  The “AmFuture Rehearsal Studio” is our newest venture, started in 2018. AmFuture invested in acoustics material and
  instruments and air-conditioning. From this we have created the perfect space for musicians to rehearse and for church groups to meet.
  Already we are seeing results and we are being approached by lots of interested clients who pay us money for the use of our studio.
  The “Amfuture Rehearsal Studio” employs the Director of Amfuture,
  Ian Muwonge, as the Coordinator of the Rehearsal Studio, and also one of the youth Joseph Ntawali as Support Coordinator.
