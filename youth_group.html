title: Youth Group
p_content: "Every Saturday afternoon, from early to late, at least 100 young people
  flood into our space for fellowship. There is loud music and lots of dancing. Each
  week the AmFuture band performs, but there is also space for other young people
  to perform, showcase talents, sing and play music.  \n\nTalks are given each week
  on different topics connected to the question— what does it mean to live a wholehearted
  life? Topics such as friendship, love, commitment, faith, integrity, authenticity
  and self-worth are just a few examples of the topics that are raised at this gathering.
  The Ugandan leaders of AmFuture run and facilitate these talks and discussions.\n\nAmFuture
  started as youth group; even as we have grown and developed programs and businesses,
  the heart and soul of our organisation will always be the youth group. \n\nIf anyone
  is interested in joining us in this journey and to help us in out work, we would
  love to talk to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome.
  Please email the chair of the board, Gemma Hayes at [g.a.hayes@rug.nl](mailto:g.a.hayes@rug.nl)\n\nIf
  you are in Australia you can donate with a tax deductible certificate at: [https://anglicanaid.org.au/projects/amfuture](https://anglicanaid.org.au/projects/amfuture
