  The Creative Arts program includes a music team that meets weekly for rehearsals and music training.
</p>
<p>
  The music team performs at AmFuture gatherings and also in the community. The youth involved also organise their
  own separate performances as they grow in their music skills.
</p>
<p>
  We have art classes for the people to simply relax and do some art, but also learn skills from our art teacher Nasuru Napagi.
  Slam poetry has come to AmFuture. Slam poetry combined writing poetry with performance. Itâ€™s the new big thing and the young
  people are loving it. The modelling group is proving popular also at AmFuture. The group make their own clothes and showcase their talents at events.
