page_content: "We chat to our Innocent about his experience as Support Coordinator
  for the AmFuture Studio.\n\n![](/static/img/IMG-20190406-WA0005.jpg) \n\n### From
  your point of view, what has been the most significant (or important) change over
  the past three months?\n\nMany youth in my local community are idle and unemployed.
  I have been blessed to be employed by AmFuture since May of 2018. I am the Support
  Coordinator for the AmFuture Studio. My main roles are to open and close the studio,
  market the studio and look after clients that pay to use the studio to rehearse,
  hold meetings and fellowships etc. Money that is made from paying clients helps
  to cover the day-to-day costs of AmFuture. I feel proud to have this position.\n\nWhen
  I started, we had few clients and made a small amount of income each month. The
  last three months has seen significant growth. The month of December was excitingly
  busy! Nearly every day or evening we had a client hire the Studio or we were asked
  to provide sound for events in the community. We now have 8 regular clients that
  use the Studio on a weekly basis (and we hope to get more once we purchase some
  new instruments and sound equipment).\n\nBy being involved in the running of the
  Studio, I have learnt how to handle clients and people who use the Studio, with
  care and respect. I am proud that I have built good relationships with our clients,
  even those who are much older than me! I have learnt and now understand what our
  clients want and what they don’t want.\n\nAmFuture provides me with a monthly wage,
  which helps me to support my parents, to pay for my younger siblings’ school fees.
  Often when we provide sound for events in the community, I am given tips by our
  clients too. The more clients that I bring to AmFuture, the more we will all benefit.
  More and more this opportunity has made me realise my passion for sound and events
  management and I pray to learn more and more about this industry.\n\n### From your
  point of view, describe what your experience would have been if this change had
  not occurred.\n\nI am one of the eldest in my family. I finished high school two
  years ago. Employment in Uganda is hard to find. If I didn’t have this opportunity
  to learn and work for AmFuture, I am sure that I and my family would be far worse
  off than we are. Being at AmFuture means that I’m constantly busy and responsible
  for the Studio, the equipment we have and the people that use the place. Without
  this change in my life, I am sure that I would be just another “freestyler” in my
  community.\n\n### Why do you understand this story to be significant (or important)?\n\nThis
  story is significant because it focuses on the change of a young person finding
  stable employment and learning new skills associated with sound and events management.
  This story also highlights that with a continued increase in the number of clients
  hiring our Studio to rehearse, hold meetings, fellowships etc. AmFuture is hopeful
  that we will reach our desire of long-term financial stability for all involved.
  Specifically, we would be able to increase Innocent’s monthly wage, which would
  have a continued positive impact on himself and his family."
