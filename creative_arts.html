p_content: "The AmFuture Creative Arts Program is on fire. This exciting area of work
  involves a music team, an art group, a modeling group, dance and slam poetry. These
  programs are popular, and fun, because they combine creativity with the potential
  to generate income.\n\nThe music team plays at all our gatherings and organises
  performances in the community.  Sometimes these are paid, or serve as fundraisers,
  and sometimes they are just something we want to do for fun in the community. \n\nWe
  are always looking for volunteers with music skills. Volunteers who can teach singing
  or instruments one-on-one. Or who can work with groups. \n\nThe AmFuture art group,
  led by Nasuru Npagi meets every week. For some of the young people it is simply
  a space to escape the chaos of the outside world and create some art. For others
  it is a chance to learn from Npagi, who makes an income from his art. The art group
  has markets in the community for selling their artworks. \n\nThe modeling group
  makes their own clothes and showcases their work at events. \n\nSlam poetry is the
  new big thing, with poetry competitions happening across the globe. AmFuture’s slam
  poetry group is a chance for young people to practice writing skills and expressing
  their thoughts and feelings. Written poems are then performed.  \n\nIf anyone is
  interested in joining us in this journey and to help us in out work, we would love
  to talk to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome. Please
  email the chair of the board, Gemma Hayes at [g.a.hayes@rug.nl](mailto:g.a.hayes@rug.nl)\n\n
