p_content: |-
  The Leadership Development program is how we train leaders. The Director of AmFuture, Ian Muwonge, as he was watching AmFuture grow, was acutely aware he could not run it alone. So he has been training up leaders within the organisation. All of them work on a volunteer basis.

  The leadership team really is the backbone of AmFuture. They set-up the space, pack it all up, cook and make tea, welcome new people, create activities and programs for the other young people. They support each other in the journey of running the varied programs and businesses that make up AmFuture.

  Every week AmFuture’s youth volunteer leaders meet to discuss where things are at and the next steps. Muwonge discusses and teaches what it means to be a leader—taking responsibility not only for AmFuture but for their own future, and the future of Uganda.

  The leadership team is a group of fine young men and women who take responsibility for a large amount of the work and day-to-day running of AmFuture. Our vision is for their bright future.

  If anyone is interested in joining us in this journey and to help us in out work, we would love to talk to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome, please click the link below to get involved.
