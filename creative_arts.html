  The AmFuture Creative Arts Program is on fire. This exciting area of work involves a music team, an art group, a modeling group, dance and slam poetry. These programs are popular, and fun, because they combine creativity with the potential to generate income.

  The music team plays at all our gatherings and organises performances in the community.  Sometimes these are paid, or serve as fundraisers, and sometimes they are just something we want to do for fun in the community.

  We are always looking for volunteers with music skills. Volunteers who can teach singing or instruments one-on-one. Or who can work with groups.

  The AmFuture art group, led by Nasuru Npagi meets every week. For some of the young people it is simply a space to escape the chaos of the outside world and create some art. For others it is a chance to learn from Npagi, who makes an income from his art. The art group has markets in the community for selling their artworks.

  The modeling group makes their own clothes and showcases their work at events.

  Slam poetry is the new big thing, with poetry competitions happening across the globe. AmFuture’s slam poetry group is a chance for young people to practice writing skills and expressing their thoughts and feelings. Written poems are then performed.

  If anyone is interested in joining us in this journey and to help us in our work, we would love to talk to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome, please click the link below to get involved.
