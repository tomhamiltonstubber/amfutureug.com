  ![](/static/img/061B0153-66AA-4E05-985C-30073891E269.jpeg)We are excited to have yet another fun-filled time with kids in our community, as they learn guitar, violin, piano and drums. Of course there will be lots of fun filled activities and snacks too. The kids will be professionally taught, observed and a report will be made at the end, about their experience during this program, which will be given to their parents/guardians. Our aim is provide a service that wholesomely benefits these young people and creates a safe and conducive atmosphere to learn about music.

  Please note that the dates highlighted in green, are the dates when the classes will be happening. The program will start on the 10th of December 2018 every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am till 12 noon. We shall be breaking off for the festive season on the 21st of December and the program will resume on the 4th of January till the 30th of January 2019.

  The cost per child for this music program is 45,000ugx per week. If you would like to register your child/children for this program please send an email to ian@amfutureug.com or call us on +256 706 559 412.
