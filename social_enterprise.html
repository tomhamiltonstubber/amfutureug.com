content: "We have been running the **Piggery** since 2015. The family of five who
  maintain the piggery live in the slums of Kampala. The Piggery has given them a
  business that enables them to pay for their childrenâ€™s education, their rent, their
  food and just to escape the daily hustle of just surviving. They are now thriving.
  Three of the children attend school and the oldest girl Irene, is now in University.
  You can read about her story here. (can you make this a link) \n\nIn the future
  we would like to help other families create and maintain businesses, and to pull
  themselves out of extreme poverty. \n\nIf you are interested in donating to help
  us replicate this success, or would like to talk with us about it, please get in
  contact with us. \n\nEmail Gemma Hayes at [g.a.hayes@rug.nl](mailto:g.a.hayes@rug.nl)
  \n\nIf you are in Australia you can donate with a tax deductible certificate at
