  was crowned Mr IUEA last Friday evening! The crowd was blown away by his talent
  of reciting thought provoking POETRY!\n\nWe are certain that this experience will
  open more and more doors for him and we are excited to see where his journey continues.
  Truly perusing ones calling, brings genuine fulfilment to ones life."
