  Every Saturday afternoon, from early to late, at least 100 young people flood into our space for fellowship. There is loud music and lots of dancing. Each week the AmFuture band performs, but there is also space for other young people to perform, showcase talents, sing and play music.

  Talks are given each week on different topics connected to the questionâ€” what does it mean to live a wholehearted life? Topics such as friendship, love, commitment, faith, integrity, authenticity and self-worth are just a few examples of the topics that are raised at this gathering. The Ugandan leaders of AmFuture run and facilitate these talks and discussions.

  AmFuture started as youth group; even as we have grown and developed programs and businesses, the heart and soul of our organisation will always be the youth group.

  If anyone is interested in joining us in this journey and to help us in out work, we would love to talk to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome, please click the link below to get involved.
