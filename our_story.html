p_content: "## Our Story\n\nThe AmFuture project began in 2014 as a small group of
  young people meeting together on a Saturday afternoon in the house of the directors,
  Sally and Ian Muwonge. Every Saturday afternoon the young people and leaders would
  meet  play music and talk about life and God in a supportive environment. \n\nHowever,
  the young people wanted more. They wanted to reach out to others; to be a positive
  presence in their families, their communities and their city of Kampala. They wanted
  to make goals and to feel empowered to achieve them. It was the energy and passion
  of these young people which led to the creation of AmFuture. AmFuture is a registered,
  non-government, charity organisation / social enterprise. We occupy a large space
  in a local mall that we gather in, housing instruments and sound equipment and a
  kitchen to cook in. We use this space to run our youth groups, creative arts programs
  and social enterprise business.   \n\nOur youth groups are asking and answering
  questions such as—what does it mean to be a positive presence in my family, community
  and city? What does gender equality in relationships look like? What does it mean
  to be a good friend? What does it mean to live wholeheartedly? How can I use my
  strengths to help myself and others? \n\nWe are a Christian organisation. We believe
  that at the centre of the universe is a loving God, and that his spirit can be awakened
  in people’s lives. We humbly follow Jesus. We, like Jesus, are deeply uncomfortable
  with poverty and injustice. We, like Jesus, believe that everyone deserves a place
  at the table. Everyone who comes to AmFuture, who joins one of our programs, will
  be welcomed and loved, no matter their faith background or beliefs.  We acknowledge
  and are so sorry that people have been hurt by the Church. We hope that we can play
  our small part in keeping the Christian tradition of loving your neighbour as yourself,
  alive in world.    \n\nThe board and the supporters of AmFuture believe in this
  group of passionate, productive, open and capable young people. We want to grow
  wise in the world together. \n\nIf anyone is interested in joining us in this journey
  and to help us in out work, we would love to talk to you!"
