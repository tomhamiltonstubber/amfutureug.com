title: Leadership and Training
p_content: "The Leadership Development program is how we train leaders. The Director
  of AmFuture, Ian Muwonge, as he was watching AmFuture grow, was acutely aware he
  could not run it alone. So he has been training up leaders within the organisation.
  All of them work on a volunteer basis. \n\nThe leadership team really is the backbone
  of AmFuture. They set-up the space, pack it all up, cook and make tea, welcome new
  people, create activities and programs for the other young people. They support
  each other in the journey of running the varied programs and businesses that make
  up AmFuture. \n\nEvery week AmFuture’s youth volunteer leaders meet to discuss where
  things are at and the next steps. Muwonge discusses and teaches what it means to
  be a leader—taking responsibility not only for AmFuture but for their own future,
  and the future of Uganda. \n\nThe leadership team is a group of fine young men and
  women who take responsibility for a large amount of the work and day-to-day running
  of AmFuture. Our vision is for their bright future. \n\nIf anyone is interested
  in joining us in this journey and to help us in out work, we would love to talk
  to you. Donations are most appreciated. Volunteers are most welcome. Please email
  the chair of the board, Gemma Hayes at [g.a.hayes@rug.nl](mailto:g.a.hayes@rug.nl)
