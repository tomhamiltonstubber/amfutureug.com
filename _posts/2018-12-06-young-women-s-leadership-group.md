  meet the last Sunday of every month with our Co-Founder Sally Muwonge. They take
  turns in hosting each other at their own homes. \n\nDuring these monthly meetings
  the girls share food, discuss different topics, talk about real life challenges
  and dreams, counsel and encourage each other. Each meeting ends with the girls praying
  for each other.\n\nLately, discussions have been based around what small business
  they can start among themselves, so that they can be financially independent.\n\nThe
  simple commitment of meeting monthly has definitely lead to these young women growing
  deeper friendships and as a result many are leading in different roles at AmFuture,
  on a regular basis."
