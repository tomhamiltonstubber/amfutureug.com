  On Easter Saturday the 20th of April 2019 we held a Street Jam in the car park of AmFuture Studio, located on Ggaba Rd, Kabalagala, Uganda. Over 2000 people from our local community came to see our youth speak, sing, dance, read their poems, act a skit, model and showcase their artwork.

  It was an amazing sunny day and a great way to market AmFuture and our awesome youth! Our founder Ian Muwonge shared an Easter message and talked to members of the community about the vision, mission and values of AmFuture. Some of our leaders gave out sweets to the little street kids, flyers about AmFuture to interested people and answered many questions.

  Local business owners and important elders in the community were impressed to see our youth having fun and showcasing their talents. Due to the hugely positive feedback we received we plan to do a Street Jam twice a year (at Easter and Christmas).
