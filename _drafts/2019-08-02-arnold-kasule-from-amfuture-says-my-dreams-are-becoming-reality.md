  The Penda Uganda Song Contest is a big deal. For youth between the age of 16 - 25 who are musically talented this is their chance to get noticed in the music industry. At AmFuture we are so super proud of Arnold Kasule. This year Arnold made it to the top 12, which is an incredible achievement. Arnold speaks to us about the journey for him and about his music. He says: "It funny how my dreams are becoming reality. My dream has been to write songs and to play them, and now people are listening to my music and appreciating it. When I sing I want to communicate and speak to people's souls. It is not just entertainment. Music is not just about a nice voice, its about communicating."
